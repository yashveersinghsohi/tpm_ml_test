# Team Process Mapping Take-Home Task: [YOUR NAME HERE].

Goal: In this pre-test, you will implement a feature extractor that detects sentiment from team conversations. Specifically, given an input of conversation data, you should output: (1) a sentiment label of ‘positive,’ ‘negative,’ or ‘neutral,’ alongside a score for each label, from 0-1. You will run your feature extractor on a dataset of team jury conversations.

You will then write a reflection on how well you think this feature extractor performed on the data. Please write your reflection in this README document.

## 1. What method(s) did you choose?
In 1-2 sentences each, describe your sentiment analysis method(s).

> [YOUR ANSWER]

## 2. Method evaluation
Next, we would like you to consider how you would evaluate your method. How do you know the classification or quantification of emotion is “right?” Try to think critically!

2a. Open up output/jury_output_chat_level.csv and look at the columns you generated. Do the values “make sense” intuitively? Why or why not?

> [YOUR ANSWER]

2b. Propose an evaluation mechanism for your method(s). What metric would you use (e.g., F1, AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)?

> [YOUR ANSWER]

2c. Describe the steps you would take in evaluating this method. Be as specific as possible.

> [YOUR ANSWER]

2d. (OPTIONAL) Implement your proposed steps in 2b, using the DynaSent benchmark dataset (https://github.com/cgpotts/dynasent). Choose the Round 2 test dataset (“Sentences crowdsourced using Dynabench”). Evaluate the model using benchmarks you have proposed, and briefly comment on the quality of your performance.

## 3. Overall reflection
3a. How much time did it take you to complete this task? (Please be honest; we are looking for feedback to make sure the task is scoped appropriately, as this is one of the first times we’re using this task.)

> [YOUR ANSWER]

3b. Finally, provide an overall reflection of your experience. How did you approach this task? What challenge(s) did you encounter? If you had more time, what are additional extensions, improvements, or tests that you would want to implement?
